            <h1>Prefix and Suffix Arrays</h1>
            <p>
            Prefix and suffix arrays are simple data structures that can be used to optimize some problems from quadratic to linear time.
            <br><br>
            Simply put, \(\text{pfx}[i]\) stores the result of an operation done for the first \(i \text{ }(1 \le i \le N)\) elements in the array (\(N\) being the size of the array). 
            <br>
            This operation can be of many types such as sums, greatest common divisor (GCD), maximums, minimums, etc.
            <br><br>
            A suffix operation array is analogous, with \(\text{sfx}[i]\) storing the result of an operation done for the last \(i \text{ }(1 \le i \le N)\) elements in the array.
            <br><br>
            Let's examine how a <b>prefix sum array</b> can help optimize our code with the following problem:
            <br><br>
            <code>Given an array with</code> \(N \text{ } (1 \le N \le 10^6)\) <code>integers, you are given </code> \(Q \text{ } (1 \le Q \le 10^6)\) <code> queries that ask you to output the sum <br>
            of the elements in the array in the range </code> \([i, j] \text{ } (1 \le i, j \le N)\) <code>.</code>
            <br><br>
            The naive way to tackle this problem is for each query, we can iterate over the range and output the resulting sum. Because we 
            will be doing this up to a <br>
            million times, and the difference between \(i\) and \(j\) can also be up to a million, multiplying these two values will result 
            in up to \(10^\text{12}\) operations, which is very slow.
            <br>
            We can also see that the time complexity of this algorithm is \(\mathcal{O}(NQ)\).
            <br><br>
            How can we optimize this?
            <br><br>
            With a prefix sum array we are able to get the sum of the first \(i\) numbers in constant time - a single array access to \(\text{pfx}[i]\).
            <br><br>
            How do we make a prefix sum array? The analysis is very simple:
            $$
            \text{pfx}[i] = \text{pfx}[i-1] + \text{arr}[i]
            $$
            In code (Java):
            <code><pre>
static int[] makePrefix(int[] arr, int n) { // n is the length of the array
    int[] pfx = new int[n];
    pfx[0] = arr[0]; // first value
    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        pfx[i] = pfx[i-1] + arr[i];
    }
    return pfx;
}
            </pre></code>
            We can simply access \(\text{pfx}[i]\) for the sum of the first \(i\) integers. Note that the creation of this array runs in \(\mathcal{O}(N)\) time.
            <br><br>
            Going back to the question, how can this help us query the range in constant time?
            <br><br>
            Notice that the sum of the range \([i, j]\) can be obtained with by subtracting \(\text{pfx}[j]\) by \(\text{pfx}[i-1]\). This is because we do not want 
            <br>
            to include any numbers <b>before</b> \(\text{pfx}[i]\) in the answer to the query. This is a <b>special property</b> of a prefix sum array.
            <code><pre>
static int query(int[] pfx, int i, int j) { // Assume 0-indexed ranges
    if (i == 0) return pfx[j];
    return pfx[j] - pfx[i - 1];
}       
            </pre></code>
            Just repeat this process for each query, and problem solved! This is also a very simple example of the <b>principle of inclusion and exclusion</b> (PIE).
            <br>
            For more information on PIE, see the following <a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Principle_of_Inclusion-Exclusion">link</a>.
            <br><br>
            As we look into higher dimensions of this data structure, we will see how this principle becomes more important.
            <br>
            The time complexity of this program is \(\mathcal{O}(Q)\), the number of queries.
            <br><br>
            In practice, it helps to \(1\)-index the data structure as extra conditionals are needed in the case where \(i = 0\) otherwise.
            <h2>Versatility</h2>
            Prefix and suffix arrays do not have to only deal with sums - many other operations are valid too, such as prefix and suffix GCD arrays.
            <br>
            Here is an problem that we can apply this to:
            <br><br>
            <code>
            Given an array of </code> \(N \text{ } (1 \le N \le 10^5)\) <code>integers, you can optionally choose one of them and replace it with an integer of your choice.
            <br>
            Find the maximum possible greatest common divisor of the entire array of integers given this operation.
            </code>
            <br><br>
            This problem may seem quite difficult at first, but here are some important things to notice.
            <br><br>
            Notice that because we only change one element, we can partition the array into \(2\) arrays \([0, i-1]\) and \([i+1, N]\) where element \(i\) is the 
            <br>
            one being modified. Next, we notice that the GCD of the \(2\) partitions is the maximum value the element can be changed to to have an impact on the total
            <br>
            GCD. The end result will be the maximum GCD of the two partitions \([0, i-1]\) and \([i+1, N]\) for all \((1 \le i \le N)\).
            <br><br>
            Now all that's left is to be able to quickly get the GCD of these partitions, and one way is to use a prefix and a suffix GCD array.
            <br>
            Note that this problem will require the knowledge of a fast GCD in \(\mathcal{O}(\log N)\). For more information,
            see the following <a href="https://cp-algorithms.com/algebra/euclid-algorithm.html">link</a>.
            <br><br>
            This way, we're able to execute the idea above in \(\mathcal{O}(N \log N)\).
            <br><br>
            <h2>2-Dimensional prefix sum arrays</h2>
            In order to make a 2-D prefix sum array, we let \(\text{pfx}[i][j]\) represent the sum of the rectangle with corners \(\text{arr}[0][0]\) and \(\text{arr}[i][j]\). 
            <br><br>
            To build the array, we can use the following recurrence (as long as all values in this expression are known):
            $$
            \text{pfx}[i][j] = \text{pfx}[i-1][j] + \text{pfx}[i][j-1] - \text{pfx}[i-1][j-1] + \text{arr}[i][j]
            $$
            Note that for this structure, we will be \(1\)-indexing our matrix for less clutter with conditionals. We also assume that the initial 
            <br>
            matrix is \(1\)-indexed, but this implementation is up to you.
            <br><br>
            In code:
            <code><pre>
static int[][] makePrefix(int[][] arr, int n, int m) {
    int[][] pfx = new int[n+1][m+1];
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= m; ++j) {
            pfx[i][j] = pfx[i-1][j] + pfx[i][j-1] - pfx[i-1][j-1] + arr[i][j];
        }
    }
    return pfx;
}
            </pre></code>
            <br>
            We add \(\text{pfx}[i-1][j]\) because it queries the sum we currently know above the cell, and \(\text{pfx}[i][j-1]\) quering the sum we currently know 
            to the left of it. 
            <br>
            Notice how a portion of these queries will be counted both times, specifically \(\text{pfx}[i-1][j-1]\), in which we should subtract it. 
            See how we use PIE here?
            <br><br>
            Querying this structure (given the known bounds \((i_1, j_1)\) and \((i_2, j_2)\) is essentially the building process in reverse.
            <br>
            Query the cell \(\text{pfx}[i_2][j_2]\), subtract the cells above this range (\(\text{pfx}[i_1-1][j_2]\)) as well as the cells to the left (\(\text{pfx}[i_1][j_1-1]\))
            <br>
            and we see that we have subtracted a certain section twice, specifically the area from \(\text{pfx}[0][0]\) to \(\text{pfx}[i_1-1][j_1-1]\). Thus, we add this back.
            <code><pre>
static int query(int[][] pfx, int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2) { // everything 1-indexed
    return pfx[x2][y2] - pfx[x1-1][y2] - pfx[x2][y1-1] + pfx[x1-1][y1-1];
}
            </pre></code>
            Building the structure has the time complexity of \(\mathcal{O}(NM)\) and queries are \(\mathcal{O}(1)\). Constant time \(2\)-D queries!!!
