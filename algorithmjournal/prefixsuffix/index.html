            <h1>Prefix and Suffix Arrays</h1>
            <p>
            Prefix and suffix arrays are simple data structures that can be used to optimize some problems from \(\mathcal{O}(N^2)\) to \(\mathcal{O}(N)\) time.
            <br><br>
            Simply put, \(\text{pfx}[i]\) stores the result of an operation done for the first \(i \text{ }(1 \le i \le N)\) elements in the array (\(N\) being the size of the array). 
            <br>
            This operation can be of many types, with <b>prefix sums</b> being very common.
            <br><br>
            Let's examine how a prefix sum array can help optimize our code with the following problem:
            <br><br>
            <code>Given an array with</code> \(N \text{ } (1 \le N \le 10^6)\) <code>integers, you are given </code> \(Q \text{ } (1 \le Q \le 10^6)\) <code> queries that ask you to output the sum <br>
            of the elements in the array in the range </code> \([i, j] \text{ } (1 \le i, j \le N)\) <code>.</code>
            <br><br>
            The naive way to tackle this problem is for each query, we can iterate over the range and output the resulting sum. Because we 
            will be doing this up to a <br>
            million times, and the difference between \(i\) and \(j\) can also be up to a million, multiplying these two values will result 
            in up to \(10^\text{12}\) operations, which is very slow.
            <br>
            We can also see that the time complexity of this algorithm is \(\mathcal{O}(NQ)\).
            <br><br>
            How can we optimize this?
            <br><br>
            With a prefix sum array we are able to get the sum of the first \(i\) numbers 
            <h2>Versatility</h2>
            Prefix and suffix arrays do not have to only deal with sums:
